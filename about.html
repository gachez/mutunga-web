                The story of Mutunga Foundation started in the year 2000 with Mama Silla, fondly known as Susu (Susu is Kamba for grandmother) and a drought ravaged Makueni area. On her way from Nairobi, Susu was one day stopped by six children who were hungry and she was moved by their plight. She took the children home and fed them.
                    This day marked the first of many days when hungry children would throng her home for food. Before long, Susu was feeding up to 30 children a day! Majority of the children that came for food were either HIV/AIDS orphans or children from extremely poor families. Most were living with grandmothers and mothers who were not engaged in any income generating activity, therefore, they could not provide for their children. The circumstances of these families led Susu to seek the support of her family; she set up a small feeding center in her home. Susu then noticed these children were not in school and so she started alongside the feeding program basic literacy classes. Susu enlisted the services of a local lady to serve as a pre-school teacher. The teacher for her service was supported by Susu to enroll and complete teacher training. This feeding center became known as Mama Silla Children’s Center. Itembukatu Ndiwa Self Help Group comprising the mothers of the children was formed; they would contribute to the feeding by collecting firewood and preparing the food. In 2004, Mama Silla Children’s Center was registered as a Community Based Organization (CBO). In 2009, Mama Silla Children’s Center was registered with the NGO Board as Mutunga Foundation.</p>
