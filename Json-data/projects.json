The experiences in Kenya, Makueni County specifically, indicate that women are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This is because; they are in charge of most of the domestic and livelihood activities. They are often responsible of their families and most of their time is spent looking for food and water which are often due to long spells of drought. The women are at the center of climate change challenge; they have been disproportionately affected as victims. Women, in Makueni and Machakos County specifically deal with multiple stresses as an integral part of their daily lives as they find themselves managing families in very strenuous circumstances where traditional livelihoods are under threat and where men are often absent. There is therefore need for innovative strategies and practices to alleviate poverty and ensure survival in the face of climate change.<\/div><div><\/div><b><br>Objective<\/b>:<br>&nbsp;Increase understanding of climate change and empower communities to take action that will increase their resilience and livelihoods. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>Justification<\/b>: <br>The effects of climate change in combination with other drivers of stress increasingly restrict access to safe water and sanitation and make food security even harder to achieve.
