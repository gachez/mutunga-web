{"id":"17","content":"0","url":"","title":"4 Days Serengeti-Ngorongoro Safari | Best time to travel: around all the year","body":"<p>During this 4 day lodge safari you will visit three well known reserves in Northern Tanzania: Lake Manyara National Park, Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti National Park. This safari is very &nbsp;unique as it makes everybody &nbsp;to enjoy &nbsp;and admire to stay there forever.<\/p><h4>Day 1: Moshi – Lake Manyara National Park.<\/h4><p>In the morning we will collect you from your hotel and take you to Lake Manyara National Park. Once you have reached the National Park Gate, your driver will open the roof of the vehicle allowing you to better observe the wonderful wildlife and scenery. Ernest Hemingway spoke of this area as the most beautiful that he had ever seen. It is easy to see why for to the west the Rift-Valley-Escarpment rises to almost 600m, and to the east the seemingly endless Maasai Steppe stretches to the horizon. In between lies the shallow and alkaline Lake Manyara where the flamingoes seem to turn the shallow waters a pink hue. On the lake’s perimeter a diverse range of animals can be found such as elephants, giraffes, buffalo, antelope and gazelles. The Manyara National Park is also well known for it’s lions which like to climb the trees- something which is quite unusual for big cats. In the late afternoon you will leave Lake Manyara National Park and spend the night at Kirurumu Manyara Lodge . Lunch; Dinner<\/p><h4>Day 2: Lake Manyara National Park – Serengeti National Park<\/h4><p>After breakfast a trip to the cooler regions high up in the crater before later reaching the Southern Serengeti. The Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Reservation in Tanzania and the Masai Mara National Park in Kenya together create one of the largest reservation areas in the world. Their combined aim is to maintain this intact continuous wildlife ecosystem – one of the few left in the world. The Serengeti National Park is famous for the ‘Great Migration’, over one million wildebeest and two hundred thousand plus zebras each year follow the rains. In October and November they travel from the mountains of the north, southwards to the plains seeking lush pastures. After the great rainy season in April, May, and June the herds then make their return ward journey. Even without this mass migration, the Serengeti is still an exciting and spectacular place that still cannot fail to enthrall. You will have your evening meal and an overnight stay at Kati Kati Tented Camp . Breakfast; Lunch; Dinner<\/p><h4>Day 3: Serengeti National Park – Ngorongoro Conservation Area<\/h4><p>Dawn is the best time to watch wildlife, therefore before breakfast the first wildlife safari of the day takes place. After breakfast another exploration tour of the Serengeti National Park follows. Here in the Senonera region you can often watch wildebeest and zebras next to lions and other big cats such as leopards and cheetahs. Lunch is taken at a picnic spot before a slow drive to the Ngorongoro Crater. On the way you will pass the Olduvai Gorge where the English pair, Louis and Mary Leak pioneered excavation work. In the sixties some of the earliest archaeological deposits of human evolution was found and a small museum (visit optional) documents these discoveries. Once you reach the crater’s rim you will be able to see into this massive caldera and down to its floor which lies 600m below. Overnight at Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge situated on the crater edge where you can enjoy the wonderful view across the caldera as the sun sets. Breakfast; Lunch; Dinner<\/p><h4>Day 4: Ngorongoro Crater – Arusha<\/h4><p>Breakfast will be at day break followed by a drive on a small road through a forested region to the crater’s floor where the landscape turns to savanna with scattered acacia trees. Here the wildlife is just breathtaking; with a little luck in just a few hours you can observe the big five – lions, elephant, buffalo, rhinoceros, and leopards. As well as these fantastic animals you can also observe warthogs, wildebeest, zebras, gazelle, antelope, hippopotami and much more. After a morning full of wildlife watching and lunch in the crater, you will return to Arusha in the afternoon.

There are fundamental gender inequalities in access to and control over productive assets such as land, labor and credit, earned income as well as gender biases in the labor market that form the ground for women and youth’s enhanced vulnerability to poverty. In addition, women’s high illiteracy rate, lack of decision making power over their fertility and early marriage of girls limit their chances of coming out of poverty. Finally, due to the disproportionate gender division of labor in the household and their increased responsibilities for domestic and productive work, women and youth tend to be more time poor.

On her way from Nairobi, Susu was one day stopped by six children who were hungry and she was moved by their plight. She took the children home and fed them.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>                            This day marked the first of many days when hungry children would throng her home for food. Before long, Susu was&nbsp;feeding up to 30 children a day! Majority of the children that came for food were either HIV\/AIDS orphans or children from extremely poor families. Most were living with grandmothers and mothers who were not engaged in any income generating activity, therefore, they could not provide for their children. The circumstances of these families led Susu to seek the support of her family; she set up a small feeding center in her home. Susu then noticed these children were not in school and so she started alongside the feeding program basic literacy classes. Susu enlisted the services of a local lady to serve as a pre-school teacher. The teacher for her service was supported by Susu to enroll and complete teacher training. This feeding center became known as Mama Silla Children’s Center. Itembukatu Ndiwa Self Help Group comprising the mothers of the children was formed; they would contribute to the feeding by collecting firewood and preparing the food. In 2004, Mama Silla Children’s Center was registered as a Community Based Organization (CBO). In 2009, Mama Silla Children’s Center was registered with the NGO Board as Mutunga Foundation.<\/div><div><br><br><\/div>","images":null,"cover":null,"summery":"","type":"about","category":"story","sub_category":null,"tags":"","keywords":null,"created":"2017-08-31 16:54:47","timestamp":"2017-08-31 16:54:47","updated":"2017-08-31 16:54:47","visible":"0","order":"1","publish":"pending","background_image":null,"background_color":null,"content_icon":null,"views":"21"},
